Open Lovart is a free, open-source AI design agent that turns natural-language briefs into full creative deliverables. Instead of picking one model and generating one asset, you describe a campaign, brand, or scene and the agent plans the deliverable list, picks the best model per asset (typography, vector, photoreal, motion), generates them in dependency order, threads brand references forward, and hands back the assembled kit. Powered by [Muapi.ai](https://muapi.ai), it orchestrates 200+ image and video models — Nano Banana 2, Flux 2 Pro, Ideogram v3, Seedream 5, GPT-Image, Recraft v3, Midjourney v7, Kling, Sora, Veo, Runway, Luma Ray2 — across a single agent loop you can self-host and modify.

**Why Open Lovart instead of Lovart, Runway Agent, Luma Labs Agent, Krea Agent?**
- **Free & open-source** — MIT-licensed, no subscription, no credit caps
- **Self-hosted** — your briefs, brand kits, and outputs stay on your machine
- **200+ models orchestrated** — image *and* video, routed automatically per asset (Flux 2, Nano Banana 2, Ideogram v3, Recraft v3, Kling, Sora, Veo, Runway, Luma Ray2)
- **Inspectable agent loop** — every plan, model choice, and intermediate output is visible and editable; nothing is black-boxed
- **Brand kit conditioning** — palette, fonts, logo, and tone persist across every generation in a campaign
- **Multi-image reference** — up to 14 images for style transfer, product placement, or character consistency
- **Static + motion in one agent** — same brief produces poster, social cutdown, and 9:16 video ad without switching tools
- **Extensible** — add your own templates, models, planners, and tool-calls; fork the agent loop; ship products on top

## ✨ Features

- **Design Agent (Chat Mode)** — Describe a brand or campaign in plain English; the agent plans deliverables, picks the right model per asset, generates them in order, and assembles the kit
- **Design Studio** — Posters, flyers, ad creatives, social graphics, presentation slides, logos, brand identities, illustrations, packaging mockups, UI screens — all from one prompt or chat thread
- **Motion Studio** — Animated logos, product motion mockups, video ads, social video cutdowns (9:16 / 1:1 / 16:9), lip-synced spokesperson clips
- **Multi-Image Reference** — Up to 14 reference images for style transfer, brand consistency, or product placement (Nano Banana 2 Edit, Flux Kontext, GPT-Image Edit, Seedream Edit)
- **Text Rendering** — Auto-route prompts containing typographic copy to text-capable models (Ideogram v3, Flux Pro Ultra, Nano Banana 2, GPT-Image)
- **Edit Mode** — Refine, recolor, restyle, expand, inpaint, or remove elements via natural-language edits
- **Brand Kit** — Persist palette, font, logo, and tone — every generation respects the kit automatically
- **Templates Library** — Pre-built recipes for Instagram posts, story ads, LinkedIn banners, YouTube thumbnails, A4 posters, business cards, e-commerce hero shots, app icons, t-shirt prints, motion ads
- **Vectorize & Export** — Convert raster outputs to SVG, remove backgrounds cleanly, upscale to 4K print-ready
- **Workflow Studio** — Visual node-based editor to chain models into repeatable design pipelines (powered by [Vibe Workflow](https://github.com/SamurAIGPT/Vibe-Workflow))
- **Smart Controls** — Aspect ratio, resolution, quality, duration, and seed pickers that adapt per model
- **Generation History** — Browse, revisit, and download every past design (persisted locally in browser storage)
- **Responsive UI** — Modern dark/glass interface that works on desktop and mobile
- **API Key Management** — Keys stored in browser `localStorage`, never sent anywhere except Muapi

### 🤖 Design Agent — How it Works

Give the agent a brief like *"launch kit for a sustainable coffee brand called Pinecone — modern, earthy, monochrome with one accent, plus a 9:16 launch video"* and it will:

1. **Plan** — break the brief into a deliverable list (logo, wordmark, palette swatches, IG launch post, story ad, A4 poster, business card, packaging mockup, 9:16 launch video, motion logo)
2. **Route** — pick the right model per asset (Recraft v3 for the logo, Ideogram v3 for the typographic poster, Nano Banana 2 Edit for product placement, Flux Pro for the hero shot, Kling / Sora / Veo / Runway / Luma Ray2 for video)
3. **Execute** — generate in dependency order, threading the brand palette and reference images forward at each step
4. **Assemble** — hand back the full kit as downloadable assets, organized by category

You can interrupt at any step, swap a model, lock a result, fork the plan, or hand-edit any intermediate output and resume.

### 🎨 Design Studio — Three Modes

| Mode | Trigger | Models | Best for |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Generate** | Default (no image) | 50+ t2i models with text-rendering routing | New designs from a brief |
| **Edit** | Reference image uploaded | 55+ i2i / inpaint / outpaint models | Refining, recoloring, restyling existing assets |

### 🔀 Workflow Studio

The **Workflow Studio** lets you build and run multi-step design pipelines without writing code.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Templates** — Start from pre-built design pipelines (logo + kit, social bundle, ad variants, product photoshoot, motion ad)
- **My Workflows** — Save and manage your own pipelines
- **Community** — Browse and run workflows published by other users
- **Node-based Builder** — Drag-and-drop visual editor connecting models and routing outputs between steps
- **Playground** — Run any workflow interactively with a form UI; results render inline
- **API execution** — Every workflow is also callable via the Muapi API
